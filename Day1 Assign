#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing,developing and maintaining software.
The importance of Software engineering is to:deliver high quality software on time within the budget, Enhances Efficiency and improves productivity by enabling teams to work collaboratively and deliver software faster,it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like finance, Supports scalability and adaptability i.e. in businesses, as it grows,their software must handle increasing user demands, implement protection practice like authentication to secure users information among others. Software engineering is backbone of the modern world, ensuring that innovations such as apps,secure banking systems, online learningplatforms exists.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Mastering Complexity, Mastering Process, and Mastering Machine
1. Mastering Complexity
The rise of large-scale software led to maintenance and scalability challenges. Structured programming improved code clarity with modular design and control structures. High-level languages like  software engineering emerged to address the software crisis.

2. Mastering Process 
Growing project complexity required structured development processes. SDLC models (Waterfall, Spiral, V-Model) standardized software design and testing, while the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) enhanced process improvement. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) introduced reusable components, aiding scalability and efficiency.

3. Mastering Machine 
Advances in hardware, cloud computing, and automation revolutionized software development. Agile and DevOps improved collaboration and speed, while AI, machine learning, and cloud platforms like AWS enabled automation and scalability. Edge computing and IoT introduced new optimization and security challenges.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Idea generation- identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
Requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
Product Design - defines software components, modules amd interactions. 
Implementation - converting software design into tangible code.
Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches
Deployment-releases the software to users
Maintainance-provides updates, bug fixes, and performance enhancements

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is best for Large projects which are structured and have well-defined requirements. example:Developing a medical device software, or Government projects, while Agile methodologies is best for dynamic projects with evolving requirements. example: Creating a mobile app startup's product, Web applications or game development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer-They design, build, test, and maintain software, work on a variety of projects, including web applications, mobile apps, and software systems,
,Maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 

Quality Assurance Engineer- ensuring products meet quality standards by deployment, implementing, and monitoring processes throughout the development lifecycle, identifying and reporting issues, and collaborating with teams to improve quality.

Project Manager- discussing the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers,organizing software projects and assigning tasks to software engineering teams according to the specifications of a task, creating blueprint for the project, assembling and leading the software development team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. example: PyCharm, VS Code
Importance of IDEs:
Code Efficiency: Features like auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and code suggestions speed up development.
Debugging Tools: Built-in debuggers help identify and fix errors quickly.
Integration: Supports various programming languages, frameworks, and third-party tools.
Project Management: Provides file management, version control integration, and build automation.

2. Version Control Systems (VCS)
A Version Control System (VCS) helps track changes to code, collaborate with teams, and maintain a history of modifications.Examples: Git, Subversion
Importance of VCS:
Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project without conflicts.
Backup & Recovery: Stores previous versions, allowing rollback if needed.
Change Tracking: Maintains a history of changes for accountability and debugging.
Branching & Merging: Enables working on different features independently before merging them into the main project.
of VCS

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
Technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry.
Software Security - Programming secure software is challenging.
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, phishing, insider and third-party threats

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. 
 Ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
Integration tests - verify that different modules used by your application work well together
 helps to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 Importance: It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. 
 Importance:Tests Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Its the art of crafting questions or a statements to get the best responsefrom AI models.
Importance: It helps to get clear and accurate responses from AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague:how do i get github
steps to follow in opening a github account
it is specific
